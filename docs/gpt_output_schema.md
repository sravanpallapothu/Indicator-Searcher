# Custom GPT Output Schema — Indicator Extractor

This document describes the structure and meaning of the fields generated by the **Indicator Extractor GPT**.  
Each row in the generated CSV corresponds to one indicator identified from a report, publication, or dashboard.

The GPT follows strict extraction rules:  
- Text is copied verbatim where specified  
- No inference or normalization is performed  
- If information is not explicitly present in the source, the field is filled as **"Not specified in document"**

---

## Field Definitions

### `indicator_id`
A document- or dashboard-scoped sequential ID.  
Uniquely identifies each indicator within the same source.  
Must remain stable for the same indicator within a given document.

---

### `dataset_report_name`
Name of the report, publication, or dashboard.  
Uses the exact visible title.  
If not shown → **Not specified in document**

---

### `indicator_name`
Short name or label of the indicator.  
Taken verbatim from:
- Table headers  
- KPI cards  
- Chart titles  
- Visible labels  

---

### `exact_indicator_text_verbatim`
The full, exact wording used in the source.  
Includes punctuation, units, qualifiers, and footnotes if embedded in the label.

---

### `definition_numerator_denominator_verbatim`
Explicit definition describing how the indicator is constructed.  
Only populated if the document explicitly states numerator and denominator.  
Otherwise → **Not specified in document**

---

### `unit_of_measurement`
The unit exactly as written (e.g., %, number, lakh tonnes).  
No normalization or inference is performed.

---

### `universe_population_covered`
Describes who or what the indicator applies to  
(e.g., households, districts, firms).  
Must be explicitly stated in the source.

---

### `indicator_type`
One of the following controlled values:

- count  
- percentage  
- rate  
- average_mean  
- median  
- ratio  
- index_composite  
- other  
- not_specified_in_document  

---

### `indicator_type_description_verbatim`
Any textual explanation describing the indicator type.  
Copied verbatim. No interpretation is added.

---

### `disaggregations`
Only explicitly shown breakdowns, such as:
- sex  
- caste  
- sector  
- management type  

For dashboards, only selectable or displayed breakdowns are listed.

---

### `geographic_granularity`
The geographic level at which data is presented, such as:
- national  
- state  
- district  

Derived only from visible labels or filters.

---

### `spatial_unit_verbatim`
Exact geographic wording used in the source  
(e.g., “State/UT”, “Aspirational Districts”).

---

### `frequency`
Reporting frequency (annual, monthly, etc.).  
Only populated if explicitly stated.

---

### `reference_period_or_date`
Time period or “as on” date exactly as written.

---

### `time_type`
One of:

- stock_as_on_date  
- flow_over_period  
- average_over_period  
- not_specified_in_document  

---

### `is_cumulative`
One of:

- explicitly_cumulative  
- explicitly_non_cumulative  
- not_specified_in_document  

---

### `data_source_type`
Type of data source, such as:
- Survey  
- Administrative data  
- Dashboard system  

Only populated if explicitly stated.

---

### `collection_method`
Method of data collection, if described.  
Otherwise → **Not specified in document**

---

### `coverage_notes_or_limitations_verbatim`
Footnotes, disclaimers, exclusions, hover text, or limitations.  
Copied verbatim from the source.

---

### `indicator_source_type`
Where the indicator was found.  
One or more of:

- table  
- figure  
- narrative_text  
- annexure  
- kpi_card  
- chart  
- tooltip  
- help_modal  

---

## Design Principles Followed

- **Verbatim extraction** — no rewriting of source text  
- **No inference** — only explicitly stated information is captured  
- **Stable identifiers** per document  
- **Consistent missing-value rule**:  
  → *"Not specified in document"*

---

## Intended Use

This schema allows consistent creation of machine-readable indicator catalogues across heterogeneous reports and dashboards, enabling search, filtering, and cross-dataset comparison.
